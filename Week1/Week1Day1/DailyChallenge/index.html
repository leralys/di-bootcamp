        <h1>Iron Man</h1>
        <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers,
            and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius,
            billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge,
            Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents
            and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan,
            while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line,
            Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home,
            he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark.
            Stark enjoyed the fame that came with his new secret identity and decided to share it with the world,
            publicly revealing himself as <span class="strong">Iron Man</span>.</p>
